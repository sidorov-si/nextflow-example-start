# nextflow-example
A minimal Nextflow project compatible with nf-core (adapted from https://github.com/marc-jones/nextflow-example).

Run this example pipeline with:

```
nextflow run main.nf -profile docker
```

To install additional modules, use the [nf-core tool](https://github.com/nf-core/tools), for example:

```
nf-core modules install star/align
```
